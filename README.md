# GOF Patterns examples

### Abstract Factory

#### Type:Creational

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their 
concrete class

### Builder

#### Type:Creational

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representing so that the same construction 
process can create different representations.

### Factory Method

#### Type:Creational

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Lets a class defer 
instantiation to subclasses

### Singleton

#### Type:Creational

Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it

### Prototype

#### Type:Creational

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and  create new objects by copying this 
prototype.

### Chain of Responsibility

#### Type:Behavioral

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object 
a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request 
along the chain until an object handles it.

### Command

#### Type: Behavioral

Encapsulate a request as an object,thereby letting you parameterize clients
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Mediator

#### Type: Behavioral

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Promotes loose
coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and it lets you vary
their interactions independently.

### Memento

#### Type: Behavioral

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state
so that the object can be restored to this state later.

### Observer Subject

#### Type: Behavioral

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes
state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### State

#### Type: Behavioral

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will
appear to change its class.

### Strategy

#### Type: Behavioral

Define a family of algorithms,encapsulate each one, and make them
interchangeable. Lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Template Method

#### Type: Behavioral

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Visitor

##### Type: Behavioral

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an
object structure. Lets you define a new operation without changing
the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### Interpreter

#### Type: Behavioral

Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter
that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

### Bridge

#### Type: Structural

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Decorator

#### Type: Structural

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Provide a flexible
alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.

### Facade

#### Type: Structural

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Defines a highlevel
interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### Composite

#### Type: Structural

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Lets
clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Adapter

#### Type: Structural

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Lets classes work together that couldn't
otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Flyweight

#### Type: Structural

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine grained objects efficiently.

### Proxy
#### Type: Structural

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
