# Patterns

Abstract Factory
Type:Creational

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their 
concrete class

Builder
Type:Creational

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representing so that the same construction 
process can create different representations.

Factory Method
Type:Creational

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Lets a class defer 
instantiation to subclasses

Singleton
Type:Creational

Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it

Prototype
Type:Creational

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and  create new objects by copying this 
prototype.

Chain of Responsibility
Type:Behavioral

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object 
a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request 
along the chain until an object handles it.
