# Patterns

Abstract Factory
Type:Creational
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their 
concrete class

Builder
Type:Creational
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representing so that the same construction 
process can create different representations.

Factory Method
Type:Creational
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Lets a class defer 
instantiation to subclasses

Singleton
Type:Creational
Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it
